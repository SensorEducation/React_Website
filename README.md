# Sensored React

This is the React implementation of SensorEd's web interface that is written in Typescript and connects to the cloud database on AWS via a AWS Lambda function written in Go.

## Setup:
- Clone the project into directory. 
- CD into it.
- `npm install` to install the packages required.
- `npm run build` to create the production build of the webapp.
- You're all done! Ask one of the members for the API key.

# React QuickStart

This is a basic React project that has TypeScript, cssnext, and webpack pre-configured so that you don't have to waste time writing boilerplate code before starting your web app.

## To get started:
- Clone this project to a local directory of your choosing
- `cd React-Quickstart` or wherever the project is saved
- `npm install` to install all package dependencies
- `npm run start` to start a dev build in webpack-dev-server
- Write all your .tsx and .pcss files in the `src/app` folder
- `npm run build` to make a production build that is outputted to the `dist` folder
